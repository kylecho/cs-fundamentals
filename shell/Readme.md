1. What Is "The Shell"?
It is a user interface available on a Unix-like system such as Linux. We have graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in addition to command line interfaces (CLIs) such as the shell.

On most Linux systems a program called bash(an enhanced version of the original Unix shell program, sh) acts as the shell program.

Terminal is a program called a terminal emulator. It opens a window and lets you interact with the shell. It gives you access to a shell session.
